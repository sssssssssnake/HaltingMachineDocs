## About
This is the documentation repository for solving the halting problem. Although, one may look at this and see that it is impossible, I think that there is a naive solution that can be used to "solve" it. Currently it should be able to parse Java (because statically typed) and use general abstract concepts to solve problems

## Why FORTRAN?

It _FAST_. Like *really* fast. It compiles to assembly, like any other language, but it is practically faster than c and doesn't have a lot to hold it back in terms of weird stuff.

Go ahead and look at the [[Basic Logic]] for how this project works, and if you want to jump right in, look at the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/sssssssssnake/HaltingMachineReader)
